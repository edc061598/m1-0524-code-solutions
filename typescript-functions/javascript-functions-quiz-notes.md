## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  Functions return a value or perform some sort of operation.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function will be another kind of object. That does not mean that the code block will run.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function has to be called for the code block in a function to run.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  With a call function, the code block will run whereas in a definition, the code block doesn't have to run.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder that has an unknown value until the function is called. An argument is the value the parameter will be holding.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function parameters are useful because they don't need to be given a value until after we've run the argument.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Allows the function to produce a value to use in the program. Prevents future code in the code block from being run.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  Using => signs for the arrow function. Assigning a variable to a function with two parameters.
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  There will be no return statement and the code block is only one line of code.
