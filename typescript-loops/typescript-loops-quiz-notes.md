## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Code reusability, working with collections of data, efficiency in repeating code and control flow of a program.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  To determine if a loop is true or false, depending on the condition.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  How many times the loop runs before it isn't executed.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expressiong will be evaluated at the beginning of the loop, after the initialization.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  Initialization will happen before the loop is executed.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It runs before the iteration of each loop to determine if it terminates.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression happens after each iteration of a loop.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  You can use a break statement in a loop.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increments the variable after the loop runs.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You can use the for in loop to iterate through the keys of an object.
